# (Paramount) Glim Video Downloader (Archival)
## What is this?
This was a video downloader centered around a program called: "Telestream GLIM". It's a web-based video player used for reviewing TV shows over cloud. 

Around late 2023, some people on Discord noticed that there were many insecure instances of GLIM on various Paramount/Viacom subdomains. In it contained finished master copies of Paramount and Syndicated TV shows/Movies, and a VOD archive. It also contained unreleased episodes of TV shows.
## If it contains unreleased content, why are you posting this publicly?
As of writing this (May 5, 2024), none of the instances work anymore. An anon on 4chan's /co/ board leaked the link a few days ago, and a couple leaked the IP addresses of the other sites yesterday.

Here's an unreleased video I made showcasing this tool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71dl9c7eoYs

Although the Paramount sites are dead now, I'm gonna be reworking my GLIM Video Downloader for other purposes.
